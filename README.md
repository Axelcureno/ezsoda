Basically the idea is to simulate a vending machine system in Android.

It uses most of Android's widgets, Intents, and some other stuff.

You are free to download it and use it for whatever you need.


Why would you need this?

Well, if you're a beginner with Android Development this might be useful as it uses a basic undestanding programming of Java and Android's fundamental technics. Also the logic is good.

There are some bugs, but mostly works. Sorry about that. =P
